# VMware scripts

Ever since I started using VMware I was interested in automating certain tasks -- apart from using VMware's vCloud / vRealize Automation suite. After pyVmomi was released, I started experimenting with it. Over time, this repository will grow and contain all my scripts that help me with vSphere administration, automation and daily operational tasks around VMware vSphere.

I am trying to keep these scripts clean and always usable, but they are always "work in progress" and I am learning Python and the VMware API as I go. So please use them at your own risks. No guarantees or liability whatsoever.

# Special Thanks
