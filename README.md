# VMware vSphere 5.x
Some Python scripts using pyVmomi to make VMware administration a little bit easier. I am learning Python and the VMware API as I go.

I am trying to keep these scripts clean and always usable, but they are always "work in progress", so please use them at your own risks. No guarantees or liability whatsoever.
